# ðŸŒ¿ Hello hello! Welcome to my GitHub!

## Glad you could make it :)

ðŸŒ™ My name's Moss, and I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for web accessibility and finding creative solutions to complex problems. Whether it's building responsive layouts, implementing accessibility best practices, or optimizing performance, I love tackling challenging projects that make a positive impact on people's lives. I am always looking to learn more about these things, and have made it a point to work towards accessibility both for myself as a user, and for the user as a developer. 

ðŸ«§ I studied at LEARN Academy, an intensive full-time coding bootcamp where I had 500+ hours of hands-on experience learning various front and back end technologies. With education on JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React, Ruby on Rails, and various styling tools, I've gained a solid foundation in modern web development and learned how to build dynamic and interactive web applications from scratch. I have also had practice with mob and pair programming in a remote setting, and would love to continue working with a team.

âœ¨ Currently, I'm an intern at LEARN, honing these skills and collaborating with other developers on a project that will go on to help better communication between LEARN instructors and their students. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies and improve my craft, and this internship has afforded me that tenfold. I am especially fond of this position as I am able to utilize the skills from my English background to cultivate my coding skills, and I look forward to continuing this in future positions!
  
ðŸŒ¸ Outside of tech(though it definitely influences my work in the tech world), I'm a creative person at heart. I love drawing, writing, listening to music--anything where I can be creative. I also love spending time with my partner and pets, and soaking up the sun whenever I can!
